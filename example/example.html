# This page contains custom HTML tokens that are expanded
# by htmlXPress before they will be usefull to a web browser.
# 
# Do not open this page in your web browser, open the corresponding
# page in the 'results' folder.


	<!-- NB. While the original intention was to remove comments and to
	     be able to use shortcuts to frequently used token combinations,
	     it is also possible to create your own non-HTML syntax to
	     compose your pages. In this way, you can reduce the amount of
	     HTML in your pages and focus on what is important: your
	     content.
